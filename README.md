This is a community maintained up-to-date fork of **New Vegas Script Extender** (NVSE). 

## Download

[Download the latest NVSE](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE/releases/latest/download/nvse_5_1_beta6.7z)

Changelogs and all releases are provided in the [releases section](https://github.com/NVSEx/NVSE/releases).

## Installation

1. Copy the .dll and .exe files to your Fallout NV directory. For Steam this is usually in your Program Files folder under *Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Fallout New Vegas\\*. If you see files named FalloutNV.exe and FalloutNVLauncher.exe, this is the correct folder. **Do not copy these files to the Data folder as with a normal mod.**

2. Launch NV via running *nvse_loader.exe* or, if you have patched the game using [FNV 4GB Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552/), *FalloutNV.exe*. Enabling the Steam Community option (enabled by default) will allow you to launch the game via Steam's standard UI.

## Description

**New Vegas Script Extender** (NVSE) is a modder's resource that expands the scripting capabilities of Fallout: New Vegas. It does so without modifying the executable files on disk, so there are no permanent side effects.


For documentation on how to write scripts utilizing NVSE, see [GECK Wiki](https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_Page).
